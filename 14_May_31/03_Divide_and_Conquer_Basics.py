Q1. What does "Divide & Conquer" mean in simple words?
Ans:
It means breaking a big problem into smaller parts, solving them, and joining the answers.
'''
# Example: To find the biggest number → split list in half → find biggest in each half → compare.



'''
Q2. What are the three steps of Divide & Conquer?
Ans:
Divide → Conquer → Combine.
'''
# Example: Split a class into two groups → check each group → decide final winner.



'''
Q3. Why do we divide a problem into smaller parts?
Ans:
Smaller problems are easier and faster to solve than one big problem.
'''
# Example: Cleaning a big room is easier if two people clean two halves.



'''
Q4. Give one real-life example of Divide & Conquer.
Ans:
Searching a name in a dictionary – open the middle, pick the correct half, repeat.
'''
# Example: Searching “S” in alphabetical pages.



'''
Q5. Does Divide & Conquer always mean recursion?
Ans:
Mostly yes, because solving smaller problems repeatedly fits recursion naturally.
'''
# Example: max(left) and max(right) → return max of both.


'''
Q6. Why is Divide & Conquer useful?
Ans:
It reduces work, increases speed, and breaks complex tasks into simple ones.
'''
# Example: Merge sort is faster than normal sorting because of splitting.
