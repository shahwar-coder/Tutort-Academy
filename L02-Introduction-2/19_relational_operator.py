# Relational Operators Demo

a = 10
b = 20

print("a =", a, ", b =", b)

print("a == b:", a == b)   # Equal to
print("a != b:", a != b)   # Not equal to
print("a > b:", a > b)     # Greater than
print("a < b:", a < b)     # Less than
print("a >= b:", a >= b)   # Greater than or equal to
print("a <= b:", a <= b)   # Less than or equal to

# a = 10 , b = 20
# a == b: False
# a != b: True
# a > b: False
# a < b: True
# a >= b: False
# a <= b: True

ðŸ“Œ Summary â€“ Relational Operators in Python  

- **Definition**: Compare two values â†’ return True/False.  
- **Operators**:  
  - == â†’ equal to  
  - != â†’ not equal to  
  - >  â†’ greater than  
  - <  â†’ less than  
  - >= â†’ greater than or equal to  
  - <= â†’ less than or equal to  

ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: Relational operators are crucial in decision-making (if-else, loops, conditions).
